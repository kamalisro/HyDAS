# HyDAS
 **Simulating Hyperspectral Satellite Data using Multispectral Satellite Data**  
<p align=”justify”> Data simulation is widely used in remote sensing to produce imagery for a new sensor in the design stage, for scale issues of some special applications, or for testing of novel algorithms. Hyperspectral data could provide more abundant information than traditional multispectral data and thus greatly extend the range of remote sensing applications. Unfortunately, hyperspectral data are much more difficult to acquire and were not available prior to the development of operational hyperspectral instruments, while large amounts of accumulated multispectral data have been collected around the world over the past several decades. Therefore, it is reasonable to examine means of using these multispectral data to simulate or construct hyperspectral data, especially in situations where hyperspectral data  are necessary but hard to acquire.</p>

  ## Unmixing
 <p align=”justify”> Linear Spectral Unmixing determines the relative abundances of materials (urban, vegetation, water etc.) that are depicted in an image. The reflectance at each pixel of the image is assumed to be a linear combination of the reflectance of each material present within the pixel.</p>

   ## Image and Spectra Visualisation
  **HyDAS allows to visualize satellite image in RGB mode, Panchromatic mode along with spectral profile**
